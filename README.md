# AI Mentor

This is the complete project supplied in `AI_Mentor_English_Comments_No_Defense_Note.zip`,
replacing the earlier science-only repository snapshot. Existing Git history is retained.

## Modules

- `app`: login, registration, home, course categories, profile and settings.
- `ui-core`: host-independent card layouts, motion resources and localized time labels.
- `data-core`: shared SQLite storage, schema migration, active account and timestamp conversion.
- `math`: mathematics dashboard, chat, solving, formulas, quizzes and study history.
- `science`: physics, chemistry, biology, quizzes and science tools.
- `history`: history chat, quizzes, notes and saved conversations.
- `programming`: programming chat, quizzes and notes.

The next architecture has nine independently owned school-subject entries:
`math`, `literature`, `english`, `history`, `geography`, `chemistry`, `physics`,
`biology`, and `economics-law`. New subject modules currently contain their entry
contracts. This release scope targets Biology, Chemistry and Physics only;
the other six remain framework-only. New curricula and lesson screens are still being implemented.
`learning-core` owns shared subject, grade, review and reward policies.
`chat-core` contains the grade-aware general tutor contract and Gemini adapter.
Legacy Science tools remain available during the gradual split into three subjects.
See [the staged redesign specification](APP_REDESIGN_2026-10-18.md).

The app package is **`com.example.asm_final`**, distinct from the earlier
`com.example.aimentor` app. Run the `app` module to open the full application.

## Open in Android Studio

Open this repository root, let Gradle sync, and run `app`. The project uses the
included Gradle **9.5.0** wrapper, Android SDK **36**, and was validated with
**JDK 21**. Install missing SDK components through Android Studio as needed.
Local SDK paths belong in `local.properties`, which is ignored by Git.

## API configuration

All four legacy modules and the new general tutor read the single root `api.properties` file at build time.
Git contains empty keys. Fill only the section for the corresponding subject:
`MATH_`, `HISTORY_`, `PROGRAMMING_`, or `SCIENCE_`. Keys are never borrowed
from a different subject. Optional rotation slots can remain empty.
The general tutor has its own `CHAT_GEMINI_API_KEY_1/2/3` pool and
`CHAT_GEMINI_MODEL`; it does not silently reuse a subject's key.
After editing, **Sync Gradle and rebuild/run** the app; installed APKs do not
read this file dynamically. Do not commit filled real keys. `local.properties`
is only for the Android SDK path. No paid AI calls were made during UI checks.

The draft backend contract is [docs/backend/openapi.json](docs/backend/openapi.json).
It describes future synchronization and permissions; no realtime backend is deployed.

## UI updates

The shell and all four feature modules share navy text, stronger blue/teal/amber/violet
accents, 20dp cards, outlined fields and 52dp buttons, with matching dark surfaces.
Short window transitions follow the system animation scale. Card rows stack on
narrow windows or at larger font scales; math and science heroes use fluid text
widths instead of fixed overlapping columns.

Login and registration share rounded Material fields, password visibility
controls, readable spacing, keyboard submission and a bounded form width.
Signup accepts a valid email from any provider, omits the phone field, and retains
bcrypt password storage. Course cards scroll on compact screens and use two columns
on wider windows.

`SystemSafeArea` applies one system-bar, display-cutout and keyboard inset
policy to the app shell and every module. Bottom keyboard space uses the
larger of keyboard/navigation insets, and padding does not accumulate.

## Debug accounts

Debug builds create these accounts if their usernames do not already exist.
Existing users and their passwords are not overwritten. Release builds do not
automatically create these accounts.

| Username | Password |
| --- | --- |
| student 01 | 123123123 |
| student 02 | 123123123 |
| student 03 | 123123123 |

Usernames contain a space before the two-digit number.

This version has no account-role column or separate administrator permission
model; all three accounts use the same standard account functionality.

## Validation

The complete debug APK builds, all existing module unit tests pass, and app
Android lint passes with warnings. `CanonicalSmokeTest` passes on the connected
Android 37 emulator for login, registration navigation, opening all four
modules and the shared system-inset behavior. Real AI response quality,
additional devices and all screen-size combinations were not exhaustively
tested in this update.

## UI handoff and next steps

See [UI_HANDOFF.md](UI_HANDOFF.md) for the shared visual rules, simplified flows,
API integration boundary and proposed next work. No new backend business logic
was added. Existing module functionality remains available.

Final UI smoke checks also passed at 320dp width, font scale 1.3, dark mode
and three-button system navigation. There are 74 passing unit tests, including calculator arithmetic and circuit laws.

## Correctness audit and architecture

See [AUDIT_SOLID.md](AUDIT_SOLID.md) for fixed findings, SOLID boundaries,
regression coverage and remaining integration work. Shared UI infrastructure now
lives in `ui-core`; account/profile and dashboard persistence are accessed through
focused interfaces. Both debug and release builds are checked.

## Comprehensive reform

See [REFORM_REPORT.md](REFORM_REPORT.md) for the detailed change list and validation.
The shell now uses Home / Subjects / Profile navigation. Existing settings remain in
Profile. Math has an in-app draggable calculator bubble, with hide/reopen controls;
other subjects never show it. Science circuits support editable voltage/resistances,
series/parallel wiring and an interactive switch with ideal DC calculations.

All account and subject helpers now use `AImentor.db`, with namespaced tables and
separate module schema versions. Existing module files are imported transactionally
and retained unchanged. Failed verification rolls back the import. These migrations
are local storage changes; cloud synchronization and new backend services are not added.

## Shared quizzes and offline history

All four subjects share quiz setup (5/10/15 questions), question presentation,
results and EXP policy. Generated quizzes are stored in the account-scoped local
bank for offline review. History screens share search, date filters and grouped
rows while retaining each module's actual conversation/question model.
KaTeX is bundled for offline math rendering. These changes include local quiz,
grading and persistence logic; they do not add a server backend.

See [QUIZ_AND_HISTORY_REPORT.md](QUIZ_AND_HISTORY_REPORT.md) for migration details,
known limitations and backend handoff, and [WORK_IN_PROGRESS.md](WORK_IN_PROGRESS.md)
for the latest verification status. The expanded unit suite contains 97 tests.

## Review-driven interface changes

See [UX_RESEARCH.md](UX_RESEARCH.md) for the dated review sample, sources, implemented
changes and limits. Home prioritizes choosing or reopening a subject; detailed statistics
remain available behind a visible toggle. Authentication forms explain errors next to the
relevant field. The Math calculator keeps its display outside the scrolling keypad.

When online AI is unconfigured, Math/History/Programming preserve the typed question
instead of pretending to send it. Science retains its local reference mode. Programming
notes only exit after a successful write or explicit discard; failed writes preserve the
draft. Math's image action is labeled as choosing an image to match the current gallery picker.


## Whole-app logic audit — 2026-10-17

See [LOGIC_AUDIT_2026-10-17.md](LOGIC_AUDIT_2026-10-17.md) for confirmed findings, corrections, review coverage and limitations. This pass fixes AI quiz parsing/answer integrity, false persistence success, chat and note recreation, tab restoration and unsaved quiz exits. It adds 13 unit tests and 10 Android regression cases. Latest verification and publication status is recorded in WORK_IN_PROGRESS.md.


## Live Gemini smoke verification — 2026-10-17

See [LIVE_API_TEST_2026-10-17.md](LIVE_API_TEST_2026-10-17.md). Eight opt-in Android cases passed with real Gemini responses using the user-authorized old API configuration. The normal 48-case offline suite remains separate; live cases are skipped unless explicitly enabled. Public API fields remain empty; temporary credential-bearing APKs were removed.

## Quiz streak and weekly progress

Streaks now count successfully completed quizzes only, including offline practice.
All subjects use explicit, untimed submission and a common mistakes-only result review.
The original home dashboard keeps its statistics and subject progress layout.
Learning streaks and local weekly quiz XP are available from Profile.
Competitive server leagues are not active yet; see [policy, research and backend handoff](STREAK_AND_LEAGUES_2026-10-17.md).


## Authentication and first-time setup — 2026-10-18

The authentication and onboarding flow uses a pastel pink light theme and a plum dark theme. Sign in with an existing username or an email. New student signup collects a name, email, password/confirmation and consent; no phone or address is required.

New students complete four introduction pages and a grade 10–12 learning profile before the Dashboard. SQLite stores account-scoped steps and profile drafts. Returning users continue an unfinished step; completed and migrated accounts do not see onboarding again. Settings includes a guide replay and learning-profile editor.

Forgot-password, reset and verification screens are present, but the email/token backend is **not connected**. Their send/verify/reset actions are disabled with an explicit explanation, never fake success. Google/Facebook sign-in is not offered without a configured provider.

See [architecture, migration, verification and backend limits](AUTH_ONBOARDING_2026-10-18.md). Demo usernames and passwords listed above remain unchanged. API key fields are still empty.
